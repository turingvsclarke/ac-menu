 ## Contributing
 
 Feel free to checkout our open issues!
 
 Currently, our standard git workflow involves issue based tracking with branches.
 
 If you are interested in working on an issue, first start by opening a branch.
 
 For example, if there is an issue called  `Example Issue #45`, you would first start by openining a branch 
 called `issue45-exampleIssue`.
 
 Then once your branch work is complete, the next step is to open a Pull Request with your issue branch and make sure to set the head to merge with -> `development`.
 
 The pull request title is also important, for example -> `issue45 Example Issue`. Once you open a pull request, a code review will be required before merging, this ensures that our contributions are reviewed.
