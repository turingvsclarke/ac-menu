# User Instructions

### Overview

This game is pretty simple. There are always to ragdolls on the screen. You can play as both ragdolls at once
or this can be a two-player game with one person controlling one ragdoll while player 2 controls the other.
The point of the game is that you are trying to smash off the opposing ragdoll's arms and legs until all that is left of it
is it's yellow torso block. You dismantle the other ragdoll by swinging your ragdoll's arms and legs back and forth
so that they collide with the little black joints that serve as the ragdoll's elbows and knees. It takes ten smacks until the
joint is broken and the arm or leg falls off of the ragdoll. Once a ragdoll has lost all of its legs and arms and all
that is left is its torso, it has lost and the other ragdoll has won the game.

### Controls

There are eight controls per ragdoll, two for each ligament. Although it is not required that the user uses all eight,
